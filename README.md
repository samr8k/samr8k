Hey there! 👋

I'm **Samrat**, a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate exploring **robotics, embedded systems, and IoT**.

I like building practical hardware–software systems using **microcontrollers, sensors, C/C++**, and **CAD**, driven by a curiosity for how real machines and intelligent systems work in the real world.

Right now, I’m focused on strengthening my **C/C++ fundamentals**, developing **embedded and IoT systems**, and improving my **mechanical design skills** for integrated hardware projects.

I’ve gained hands-on experience working with **embedded microcontroller platforms and development tools**, along with **Git, OpenCV, VS Code, and CAD software** for prototyping and system design.

I’m open to **internships, collaboration, and thoughtful conversations** around robotics, embedded systems, and IoT.
